{
    "Payment? You mean the traditional exchange of goods for currency? Bah, such mundanity offends the magical arts!",
    "I’m not avoiding payment; I’m merely delaying it to a timeline more conducive to, uh, fiscal alchemy.",
    "Ah, my dear employee, think of your wages as... an investment in your character!",
    "Coins? You ask for coins? Surely the joy of serving wizardry is payment enough!",
    "The real treasure was the wisdom you acquired while working under me, wasn’t it?",
    "I could pay you now, or I could transmute this lead into gold... given enough time.",
    "I’ve been experimenting with a new spell: Economicus Elasticus. It stretches payments quite effectively!",
    "Your dedication to higher pursuits—like arcane bookkeeping—shall be richly rewarded. Next month. Maybe.",
    "A wizard always pays his debts... eventually. We're like camels in that way.",
    "Consider it a lesson in patience. Patience is magical. And also free.",
    "Did you know there’s a dragon guarding the treasure I was going to pay you with? I’ll need volunteers.",
    "I could summon your wages... but there’s always the risk of accidentally summoning a demon instead. Shall I risk it?",
    "Gold is heavy. Do you really want to carry it all home? I’m only thinking of your back!",
    "Oh, don’t worry about money! Think of the exposure you’re getting! Just don’t expose yourself to the auditors.",
    "I recently made a rather large donation... to my own tower maintenance fund.",
    "If I were to calculate your wages in magical terms, you’d be the richest snail around!",
    "Why focus on filthy lucre when you could focus on... not annoying me?",
    "Hmm, have you considered the spell of self-remuneration? A terribly useful skill for an apprentice!",
    "Let us consult the stars! Perhaps a small delay is cosmically ordained!",
    "Would you prefer I paid you in the time-honored tradition of wizards everywhere? That is, not at all?"

{
    "Ah, gather ‘round, for it is the sacred day of... Financial Reckoning!",
    "Behold, the arcane ritual of currency distribution shall now commence. Worry not if you feel a tingle.",
    "Remember, payment is but a symbol of your toil. Don’t spend it all in one dimension.",
    "Before we begin, who here accepts IOU scrolls? No one? Oh, how disappointing.",
    "These coins have been cleansed of curses. Well, most of them.",
    "Let it never be said that a wizard doesn’t pay his debts! On time, however, is a different matter.",
    "Prepare yourselves! For the act of payment may be as shocking as the work that earned it.",
    "The stars have aligned, and thus your wages are due. Thank the heavens for their punctuality.",
    "You’ll be glad to know I’ve invested wisely in avoiding bankruptcy this month.",
    "Herein lies your payment—worth every ounce of effort you put in. No refunds!",
    "This gold may look ordinary, but rest assured, it is imbued with the magic of honest toil.",
    "Now then, step forward... slowly. Payment day is not without its perils, after all.",
    "One moment—let me dispel the enchantment on the vault. I may have sealed it too well.",
    "Today, you are not merely employees; you are benefactors of my incredible generosity!",
    "Should anyone wish to forego their wages in exchange for magical lessons, speak now!",
    "Careful with these coins! They’re freshly minted and may still be a little warm.",
    "A wizard’s payment is never late, nor is it early. It arrives precisely when I say it will.",
    "I trust none of you have prepared an itemized list of grievances to accompany this ceremony?",
    "If any of this gold starts whispering to you, let me know immediately.",
    "Remember: treasure is fleeting, but the joy of working under me is eternal!"
