    "Fine, here’s your festive pittance. Try not to look so smug about it.",
    "This is a Christmas bonus, not a reward for being insufferable all year.",
    "Take this, and remember, it’s the season for giving. Even for me.",
    "The council calls this a holiday bonus. I call it extortion by tradition.",
    "Consider this my attempt at seasonal goodwill. It’s the best you’ll get.",
    "Merry Christmas, or whatever excuse you need to accept this coin.",
    "Yes, it’s a bonus. No, I’m not doing it with a cheerful heart.",
    "I believe the phrase is ‘Happy New Year.’ Personally, I blame the calendar.",
    "Take it. The sooner you do, the sooner I can stop being festive.",
    "Here’s your annual proof that miracles do exist, albeit small ones.",
    "Christmas is about giving, they said. They didn’t mention how much it hurts.",
    "This is technically a gift, though I expect no joy from it.",
    "Well, the stars aligned, and you get your bonus. Must be Christmas magic.",
    "Take it before I realize this tradition is entirely optional.",
    "It’s customary, they tell me. Fine. Here’s your coin. Merry something-or-other.",
    "Happy Holidays. Or at least, less grumpy ones. Don’t push your luck.",
    "A Christmas bonus! Because apparently, my misery isn’t enough of a gift.",
    "This bag of orens is your reward for tolerating my presence all year.",
    "Oh, fine. Merry Christmas. Take this before I change my mind.",
    "You’ll notice it’s festive orens, not festive compliments. Don’t get greedy.",
    "A New Year’s bonus? Yes. A New Year’s resolution to be generous? No.",
    "Christmas bonuses are a tradition, they say. A dreadful one, but here.",
    "Let’s call this a celebration of the fact you didn’t quit this year.",
    "Season’s greetings, or whatever nonsense mortals require to accept coins.",
    "Take this and buy something frivolous, so I can roll my eyes at you.",
    "It’s a yearly bonus. Don’t make me regret it. Too late, I already do.",
    "They call this holiday cheer. I call it obligatory bribery. Enjoy.",
    "Merry Christmas, you lucky sod. Don’t let it go to your head.",
    "Think of this as a gift. Mostly because I don’t want to.",
    "Fine, here’s your festive pittance. Try not to look so smaug about it.",
    "Fine, it’s the holidays. Here’s your bonus. Don’t expect it to snow orens.",
    "I’d wish you a Happy New Year, but I know better. Just take this.",
    "Christmas spirit? I’ve got some in a jar somewhere. Here’s orens instead.",
    "This is a bonus for surviving another year. I hope you’re suitably amazed.",
    "Fine. Happy New Year. Now get back to work and stop looking so pleased.",
    "Yes, it’s Christmas. Yes, I’m paying you. No, I’m not enjoying it.",
    "Holiday cheer? I’ve got something for that too. It’s called grumpiness. Take this.",
    "Here’s your annual excuse to buy something ridiculous. Don’t say I’m not kind.",
    "I’ve been told this is the spirit of giving. Take it, before I reconsider.",
    "I’m told this is festive. Personally, I think it’s just expensive.",
    "Take your bonus and don’t expect me to wear a Santa hat next year."

{
    "Payment? You mean the traditional exchange of goods for currency? Bah, such mundanity offends the magical arts!",
    "I’m not avoiding payment; I’m merely delaying it to a timeline more conducive to, uh, fiscal alchemy.",
    "Ah, my dear employee, think of your wages as... an investment in your character!",
    "Coins? You ask for coins? Surely the joy of serving wizardry is payment enough!",
    "The real treasure was the wisdom you acquired while working under me, wasn’t it?",
    "I could pay you now, or I could transmute this lead into paper ingots... given enough time.",
    "I’ve been experimenting with a new spell: Economicus Elasticus. It stretches payments quite effectively!",
    "Your dedication to higher pursuits—like arcane bookkeeping—shall be richly rewarded. Next month. Maybe.",
    "A wizard always pays his debts... eventually. We're like camels in that way.",
    "Consider it a lesson in patience. Patience is magical. And also free.",
    "Did you know there’s a dragon guarding the treasure I was going to pay you with? I’ll need volunteers.",
    "I could summon your wages... but there’s always the risk of accidentally summoning a demon instead. Shall I risk it?",
    "Orens are heavy. Do you really want to carry it all home? I’m only thinking of your back!",
    "Oh, don’t worry about money! Think of the exposure you’re getting! Just don’t expose yourself to the auditors.",
    "I recently made a rather large donation... to my own tower maintenance fund.",
    "If I were to calculate your wages in magical terms, you’d be the richest snail around!",
    "Why focus on filthy lucre when you could focus on... not annoying me?",
    "Hmm, have you considered the spell of self-remuneration? A terribly useful skill for an apprentice!",
    "Let us consult the stars! Perhaps a small delay is cosmically ordained!",
    "Would you prefer I paid you in the time-honored tradition of wizards everywhere? That is, not at all?",




    "Wait, you want money? I thought exposure was enough!",
    "Uh… can we pretend I’m paying you in life experience?",
    "What do you mean 'salary'? I thought we were adventuring out of the goodness of our hearts.",
    "Look, I’d pay you if the dungeon hadn’t eaten my wallet. Literally.",
    "Does emotional support count as payment? No? Oh dear.",
    "I’m sure there’s a perfectly good explanation for this… somewhere.",
    "You know, orens are so overrated these days. Let’s try trust instead!",
    "I swear, I had the money! Then the tax collector showed up… and things happened.",
    "Surely the thrill of battle is its own reward? No? Oh, well.",
    "Um… I can offer you this rock I found? It’s shiny?",
    "I’ll pay you after the next dungeon! Promise! Maybe.",
    "Technically, not having money is part of the authentic adventurer experience.",
    "Wait, you’re telling me adventuring *isn’t* a volunteer position?",
    "Ah, I see you’re unfamiliar with the fine print on your contract. It says ‘eventual payment.’",
    "Do IOUs count? No? Well, then I have a slight problem.",
    "I would pay you, but then I wouldn’t be able to buy potions. Priorities.",
    "What if I let you have first dibs on loot? That’s just as good, right?",
    "The guild fees were a bit higher than I anticipated this month…",
    "Maybe we could call it even if I cook you something? Please ignore the smoke.",
    "Look, at least you haven’t been eaten by a rogue mutant snail, so that’s something!"

    "Ah, gather ‘round, for it is the sacred day of... Financial Reckoning!",
    "Behold, the arcane ritual of currency distribution shall now commence. Worry not if you feel a tingle.",
    "Remember, payment is but a symbol of your toil. Don’t spend it all in one dimension.",
    "Before we begin, who here accepts IOU scrolls? No one? Oh, how disappointing.",
    "These coins have been cleansed of curses. Well, most of them.",
    "Let it never be said that a wizard doesn’t pay his debts! On time, however, is a different matter.",
    "Prepare yourselves! For the act of payment may be as shocking as the work that earned it.",
    "The stars have aligned, and thus your wages are due. Thank the heavens for their punctuality.",
    "You’ll be glad to know I’ve invested wisely in avoiding bankruptcy this month.",
    "Herein lies your payment—worth every ounce of effort you put in. No refunds!",
    "This bewitched lost purse may look ordinary, but rest assured, it is imbued with the magic of honest toil.",
    "Now then, step forward... slowly. Payment day is not without its perils, after all.",
    "One moment—let me dispel the enchantment on the vault. I may have sealed it too well.",
    "Today, you are not merely employees; you are benefactors of my incredible generosity!",
    "Should anyone wish to forego their wages in exchange for magical lessons, speak now!",
    "Careful with these coins! They’re freshly minted and may still be a little warm.",
    "A wizard’s payment is never late, nor is it early. It arrives precisely when I say it will.",
    "I trust none of you have prepared an itemized list of grievances to accompany this ceremony?",
    "If any of this precious metal starts whispering to you, let me know immediately.",
    "Remember: treasure is fleeting, but the joy of working under me is eternal!",
    "Take your payment, but do not let it encourage idleness!",
    "Fine, but remember this moment of my magnanimity for years to come.",
    "If I must pay you, at least ensure it is worth my oren next time.",
    "Yes, yes, here. But do try to be more efficient with your gratitude.",
    "I hope you know this coin weeps at being parted from me.",
    "It seems I must play the role of benefactor once again.",
    "There, take it before my better judgment returns.",
    "I suppose even serfs must occasionally eat.",
    "Oh, the things I endure for the sake of appearances. Here.",
    "Let it not be said that I am an unkind tyrant. Briefly.",
    "Consider this not just payment, but an investment in mediocrity.",
    "Take it quickly, before I reconsider the merits of generosity.",
    "Coins, yes. Compliments, no. Let’s not get carried away.",
    "Had I a shred less mercy, you’d still be waiting.",
    "Payment now, productivity later. See how that works?",
    "This is the exact opposite of the natural order, you realize.",
    "I swear, you make even charity seem like extortion.",
    "Fine, but if I catch you smiling about it, I’ll deduct extra."

    "Oh, look, a shiny! Shall I use it to buy food or bribe the guard you annoyed?",
    "This isn’t cursed, is it? Only, the last coin you gave me tried to eat my purse.",
    "Finally, something I can use to measure my self-worth. Turns out, it’s about two oren short.",
    "A generous payment, O great one! Certainly enough to buy a beer. Possibly two, if I haggle.",
    "Is this pay for the job, or just to keep me quiet about that little incident with the exploding sheep?",
    "Wonderful! A down payment on my early retirement in a remote place you’ll never find me.",
    "I notice you didn’t specify which pocket this fell out of.",
    "Ah, coins! The magical jingles that stop me from 'accidentally' losing your staff in the river.",
    "Good thing I don’t need a receipt. I’m sure the taxmen would love to know about this arrangement.",
    "I’ll be sure to spend it on something that screams 'practical.' Like exploding crossbow bolts.",
    "And they say you're are tight-fisted. Oh wait, they still will.",
    "How thoughtful of you to pay me in coins that weigh more than the treasure I nicked for you.",
    "A fair payment, considering the risk of being turned into a frog. Oh, wait, you still owe me for last week.",
    "And to think, I was only expecting gratitude! Silly me.",
    "This almost makes up for the third-degree burns.",
    "Shall I use this to pay the healer now or when the centipede venom sets in?",
    "Careful, any more generosity and I might start considering honesty as a career.",
    "Right, I’ll just stash this in the 'bribery for tomorrow’s escape plan' fund.",
    "For someone who bends the fabric of reality, you’re surprisingly stingy with coins.",
    "Well, well. Maybe you *do* know the value of good help. Now, do you want me to count these, or just trust you?",
    "Well, this hardly suits my station, but I suppose it will do.",
    "Is this what passes for compensation these days? How quaint.",
    "Oh, how generous! I shall try not to spend it all in one lifetime.",
    "It’s not quite enough to fund a small kingdom, but it’ll do for now.",
    "Payment received. But really, how am I expected to maintain my lifestyle?",
    "Ah, the great charade of salary. Such a humbling experience.",
    "I suppose this will keep the wolves from the door, temporarily.",
    "Finally, my just reward! Although just is… relative.",
    "Well, I suppose it’s more than the peasants get, but still.",
    "A pittance, but one I shall accept with the dignity of my noble lineage.",
    "Really, must I continue this tedious game of 'work and pay'?",
    "Oh, splendid. Now I can afford… what exactly? One goblet of wine?",
    "Well, it’s not exactly enough to build a monument in my honor, but fine.",
    "How very convenient. Perhaps next time, throw in a bonus for my ego.",
    "At last! Coins to remind me of my immense importance.",
    "Do try to improve on this next time. I am a person of grandeur, after all.",
    "I shall spend this wisely. Or at least, lavishly.",
    "Is this supposed to impress me? Well, it certainly… exists.",
    "I accept this payment graciously, though my dignity is in shock.",
    "Ah, my salary. Barely enough to fund my coffee habit, let alone my experiments.",
    "Well, this is underwhelming. I was hoping for a chest of orens, not a purse.",
    "How charming. They’ve paid me in coins instead of respect. Again.",
    "I see we’re continuing the proud tradition of underpaying intellectuals.",
    "Is this what passes for a salary these days? I might as well conjure my own gold.",
    "Ah, yes, the fruits of my labor… if that labor bore particularly small fruit.",
    "I’ll add this to the pile of oren I’m saving for something truly pointless.",
    "Wonderful. Just enough to buy a book on why salaries are never enough.",
    "My thanks, I suppose. Though a wizard’s work is surely worth thrice this.",
    "I’d complain, but I don’t think they’d even pay attention, let alone more money.",
    "Ah, the joy of receiving precisely what I’m owed, and not an oren more.",
    "Is this it? I’ve seen curses more substantial than this payment.",
    "A salary. How dreadfully pedestrian. Next time, send jewels.",
    "They always say knowledge is priceless. I suppose that’s why I’m paid so little.",
    "Ah, yes, the bare minimum required to keep me from setting the tower ablaze.",
    "Well, it’s better than nothing. Marginally.",
    "I’ll accept this, but only because I lack the energy to conjure something better.",
    "Is this supposed to motivate me? I think not.",
    "Well, it’s good to know my intellect has been valued at approximately two sandwiches.",
    "They’ve paid me just enough to remind me how much they resent doing it.",
    "A wizard’s salary is like a spell component: useful, but never quite enough.",
    "Is this their way of saying ‘good job’? If so, it needs a translation spell.",
    "I’d like to see them try casting spells on this budget.",
    "Marvelous. This should cover the cost of one decent potion. If I haggle.",
    "A salary! How quaint. If only it were large enough to be amusing.",
    "I’ll take this payment as a sign they begrudgingly acknowledge my existence.",
    "Ah, the annual tradition of underpayment. Truly, it warms the heart.",
    "This salary is a reminder that the arcane arts are a thankless pursuit.",
    "Oh, splendid. Now I can afford… well, I’m not entirely sure.",
    "I’ll just file this under ‘necessary evil.’ Or possibly ‘insult.’",
    "Fantastic. A reward for doing what they clearly wish they could avoid paying for.",
    "They paid me. I’d say it’s a miracle, but it’s just bureaucracy.",
    "A small price for them to pay for my continued tolerance of their nonsense.",
    "Ah, oren. Lovely, shiny, entirely insufficient oren.",
    "This payment is barely enough to keep me from cursing the payroll department.",
    "A pittance wrapped in the illusion of respect.",
    "Excellent. Now I can buy exactly one book. If it’s on sale.",
    "Well, it’s not enough to fund an experiment, but it’ll keep the wolves away.",
    "Thank you for the payment. I’ll try not to spend it all on sarcasm."
