		Pay your party members a salary every month, week, or day.  By default it pays a salary of 10% of your on hand orens, split to all your party members, if you have at least 5k on hand.
		If you change a setting you can pay a yearly bonus as well.

		You can change all of these in your Elin game folder in BepInEx/config/mrmeagle.elin.partywage.cfg
